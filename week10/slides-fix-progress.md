## ✅ **COMPLETED (Phase 1 & 2 Major Fixes)**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Issues - DONE**
- ✅ Fixed marketing claims in Slide #2
  - Changed "12 critical vulnerabilities" to "Master 6 critical vulnerabilities + explore 6 additional risks"
  - Updated attack/defense descriptions to be more accurate

- ✅ Added Workshop Structure clarification (New Slide #4)
  - Clear distinction between "Deep Dive" (6) vs "Overview" (6) vulnerabilities
  - Lists exactly which vulnerabilities get hands-on time

- ✅ Removed duplicate Slide ID 21
  - Eliminated duplicate IDOR wrap-up slide

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Content Structure - DONE** 
- ✅ Added transition slide (Slide #40)
  - "Congratulations! Core Skills Completed"
  - Clear transition from hands-on to overview section

- ✅ Expanded Additional Vulnerabilities Section
  - Replaced brief Slide #40 with 7 detailed slides (41-47)
  - Each additional vulnerability now has: Definition + Example + Mitigation + OWASP reference
  - Added: Supply Chain, Model Poisoning, System Prompt Leakage, Vector Weaknesses, Misinformation, Session Security

- ✅ Updated conclusion slide (Slide #55)
  - Added "Your Next Steps" with 4 actionable items
  - More comprehensive wrap-up

## ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**

### **Slide ID Renumbering**
- ✅ Slides 1-4: Correct
- ✅ Slides 5-22: Partially updated (some still need fixing)
- ✅ Slides 40-47: New slides, correctly numbered
- ✅ Slides 48-55: Final section, correctly renumbered
- ⚠️ Slides 23-39: Need systematic renumbering (XSS through Model DoS sections)

## 🔄 **REMAINING WORK**

### **High Priority**
- [ ] Complete slide ID renumbering for slides 23-39
- [ ] Update time references in Red Team Challenge slides (7→10 minutes)
- [ ] Fix code examples in defense implementation slides

### **Medium Priority (Phase 3 & 4)**
- [ ] Add interactive "Quick Check" slides after each vulnerability
- [ ] Enhance code examples for copy-paste friendliness
- [ ] Add QR codes or short links for resources
- [ ] Update OWASP references to 2025 version

### **Lower Priority (Phase 5)**
- [ ] Add self-assessment checklist slide
- [ ] Create vulnerability-specific resource cards
- [ ] Add community contribution suggestions

## 📊 **Current Status**

**Total Slides**: 55 (was 48, added 7 new slides)
**Structure**:
- Slides 1-3: Introduction
- Slide 4: Workshop Structure (NEW)
- Slides 5-39: 6 Deep Dive Vulnerabilities (need ID fixes)
- Slide 40: Transition (NEW) 
- Slides 41-47: 6 Additional Vulnerabilities (NEW)
- Slides 48-55: Wrap-up and Resources

**Key Improvements Made**:
1. **Clear Expectations**: Students now understand 6 hands-on + 6 overview = 12 total
2. **Better Content**: Additional vulnerabilities have proper detail instead of brief mentions
3. **Logical Flow**: Clear transition between deep-dive and overview sections
4. **Actionable Ending**: Specific next steps provided

## 🎯 **Assessment**

The major alignment issues identified in fixSlides.md have been **successfully resolved**:

- ✅ Marketing claims now match reality
- ✅ Workshop structure is clearly explained  
- ✅ Additional vulnerabilities have proper coverage
- ✅ Flow between sections is logical
- ✅ Student expectations are properly set

**Remaining work is mostly housekeeping** (ID renumbering) and **enhancements** (interactive elements, better code examples).

The slides now **properly align with the workshop plan** and provide a much better learning experience!
