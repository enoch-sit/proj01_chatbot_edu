| Chatbot Functionality and Design (UI) | Evaluates UI's intuitive design, responsiveness, and seamless interaction for organization-specific inquiries, emphasizing Scrum/Agile principles like iterative development, adaptive planning, user feedback, and sprint refinement. Reflects values such as change response, collaboration, and improvement via user stories, reviews, and MVIs. Weighted 15%. | Demonstrates strong integration with iterative sprint enhancements and user stories guiding design (e.g., evolving persona flows from refinement). Exceptional responsiveness with reasoned choice of frontend frameworks (e.g., React for modular components, Vue for quick iterations). Collaborative involvement yields seamless, scalable interface with framework-enabled innovations like A/B testing. Embodies Agile's working software focus. | Applies principles effectively through iterative design in artifacts (e.g., refined stories for layouts). Mostly smooth interactions with some feedback, but less proactive adaptations. Visuals enhance usability with minor inconsistencies. Aligns with values, showing room for deeper refinements. | Includes basic elements like initial stories and iterations, but lacks depth in planning/feedback. Adequate interactions with functional visuals, yet limitations indicate superficial application. Meets minimums but misses evolutionary opportunities. | Lacks adherence, with disjointed design missing iterations/feedback. Fails effective interactions, poor visuals, minimal collaboration. Major issues indicate rigid approach opposing Agile values.
