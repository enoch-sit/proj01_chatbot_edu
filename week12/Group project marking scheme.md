## Bonus Points

**Note:** Bonus points are awarded to individuals

- If you score 89% (denoted as a) and earn a 10% bonus (denoted as b), the initial total would be a + b = 89 + 10 = 99%.
- If you score 91% (denoted as a) and earn a 10% bonus (denoted as b), the initial total would be a + b = 91 + 10 = 101%. The final mark is determined by taking the minimum of this total and 100%, so min(a + b, 100) = min(101, 100) = 100%
