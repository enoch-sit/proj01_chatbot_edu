1. Project Title

   [Title of Your Report, e.g., Critical Analysis of a Chatbot for Customer Service in the Finance Sector]

2. Introduction (300 words)

   [Provide an overview of the chatbot developed by your group, including its purpose, organizational context (e.g., healthcare, law, education, finance, domestic, or customer service), key features, and development process. Include a strong thesis statement outlining the main strengths, weaknesses, and improvement areas. Briefly reflect on the role and contribution of each team member. Outline the structure of the report. Ensure this section links to course concepts like Agentic AI or Agile/Scrum methodologies.]

3. Critical Analysis of Performance (500 words)

   [Evaluate the chatbot's strengths and weaknesses in depth, supported by evidence such as data from testing, user feedback, or performance metrics. Analyze root causes and link them to course concepts (e.g., Agentic AI limitations, integration issues, or ethical concerns). Discuss aspects like accuracy, user engagement, scalability, and any legal liabilities (e.g., data privacy). Use examples to illustrate points, and incorporate visuals or appendices if needed for data support.]

4. Suggestions for Improvement (500 words)

   [Provide at least 3 feasible, prioritized, and actionable recommendations tied directly to the analysis. Incorporate Agile/Scrum methodologies for iterative improvements, address legal aspects (e.g., liabilities, privacy compliance), and discuss potential outcomes or impacts. Explain how each suggestion could enhance performance, with references to course materials where relevant.]

5. Conclusion and Reflection (200 words)

   [Summarize the key findings from the analysis and suggestions. Reflect on lessons learned from the project (e.g., group dynamics, Agile approach challenges). Provide forward-looking insights on the chatbot's potential or broader implications for AI in the chosen context.]
