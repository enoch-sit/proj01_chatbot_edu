## 🎯 Key Features for Traceability

### 1. Complete URL Documentation
Every source requires:
- ✓ Full URL from browser address bar (exact copy-paste)
- ✓ URL from Google search results (original)
- ✓ Domain analysis (.gov.hk priority)
- ✓ URL verification (tested working)

### 2. Source Credibility System
5-tier system with mandatory justification:
- **Tier 1** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - .gov.hk AND official .org.hk (e.g., pcpd.org.hk), official regulatory
- **Tier 2** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - .edu.hk, international bodies, industry .org.hk
- **Tier 3** ⭐⭐⭐ - Major law firms, legal publishers
- **Tier 4** ⭐⭐ - Reputable news outlets
- **Tier 5** ⭐ - Unverified (requires corroboration)

**Important**: `.org.hk` requires verification - can be Tier 1 if official statutory body OR Tier 2-3 if industry association.

### 3. Playwright MCP Workflow
7-phase systematic process:
- Phase A: Session initialization
- Phase B: Execute search
- Phase C: Capture results overview
- Phase D: Evaluate & prioritize sources
- Phase E: Investigate each source (detailed)
- Phase F: Complete documentation
- Phase G: Search session wrap-up

### 4. Screenshot Evidence
For every source:
- Search results page screenshot
- Source page header/top
- Key content sections
- Footer with contact info
- All files systematically named

### 5. Quality Verification
Multiple checkpoints:
- Pre-search query verification
- During-search credibility assessment
- Post-search URL testing
- Traceability audit
- Minimum 2-source corroboration

## 🚀 How to Start Research

### Step 1: Read Documentation (15 minutes)
1. Review `research_plan.md` - Understand Phase 1 searches
2. Read `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_GUIDE.md` - Learn the workflow
3. Check `SOURCE_CREDIBILITY_GUIDE.md` - Memorize Tier 1 domains

### Step 2: Prepare Session
1. Open `progress_logs/research_tracker.md` - See what to search
2. Create new search log: `progress_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_search-log.md`
3. Have `notes_template.md` ready to copy
4. Ensure `/screenshots/` folder accessible

### Step 3: Execute First Search (Phase 1.1.1)
**Query**: "Hong Kong Personal Data Privacy Ordinance PDPO compliance requirements"

Follow PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_GUIDE.md workflow:
1. Navigate to Google
2. Enter search query
3. Screenshot results
4. Identify .gov.hk or pcpd.org.hk sources
5. Visit top 3-5 sources
6. For each source:
   - Assess credibility (Tier 1-5)
   - Take screenshots
   - Extract key findings
   - Create notes file
   - Test URL
7. Update search log
8. Check off in tracker

### Step 4: Continue Systematically
- Complete all 5 Phase 1.1 searches (Hong Kong PDPO)
- Then Phase 1.2 (International frameworks)
- Then Phase 1.3 (Sector-specific)
- Update progress daily

## 📊 Progress Tracking System

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: Review yesterday's progress log
2. **Session**: Execute 3-7 searches (15-20 sources documented)
3. **During**: Update search log in real-time
4. **After Each Search**: Check off in research_tracker.md
5. **Evening**: Create today's progress log

### Quality Checks
After each search session:
- [ ] All URLs tested and working
- [ ] All screenshots saved with correct names
- [ ] All sources have credibility tier + justification
- [ ] Minimum 3-5 sources documented per query
- [ ] At least 1 Tier 1-2 source when available
- [ ] Search log updated
- [ ] Research tracker checkboxes updated

## 🎓 Hong Kong Priority Domains

**MEMORIZE THESE - Tier 1 Official Sources**:

| Domain | Organization | Domain Type | Priority |
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| `pcpd.org.hk` | Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data | **.org.hk** ⚠️ | **HIGHEST** |
