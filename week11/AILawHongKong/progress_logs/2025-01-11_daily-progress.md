## Lessons Learned

### Successes
1. ✅ **Tier 1 source dominance:** 60% of top 10 results were official sources - excellent quality
2. ✅ **PCPD as primary authority:** pcpd.org.hk confirmed as THE authoritative source for PDPO
3. ✅ **AI Overview useful:** Google AI Overview provided accurate DPP summary
4. ✅ **Documentation efficiency:** Templates enabled fast, comprehensive note-taking
5. ✅ **Playwright MCP reliability:** Browser automation worked without issues

### Adjustments Needed
1. ⚠️ **PDF handling:** Need strategy for 60-page and 187-page PDFs (download, review key sections)
2. ⚠️ **Time estimation:** Single source investigation took longer than expected - adjust expectations
3. ⚠️ **Content depth:** Source notes very detailed (500+ lines) - may need to balance depth vs breadth

### Next Steps Refinement
1. For PDF sources: Download, scan table of contents, extract key sections only
2. For .gov.hk legislation: Focus on specific sections relevant to chatbot/AI (don't read entire 187 pages)
3. Consider creating "quick reference" summary documents alongside detailed notes
