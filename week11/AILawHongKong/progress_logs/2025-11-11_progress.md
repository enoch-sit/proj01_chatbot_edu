## Work Completed

### Planning and Setup (100%)
1. ✅ **Research Plan Created**
   - File: `research_plan.md`
   - 5 phases defined with 90+ search queries
   - Methodology and deliverables documented

2. ✅ **Folder Structure Established**
   - Created hierarchical folder system
   - 22 topic-specific subdirectories
   - Supporting folders for screenshots, case law, reports

3. ✅ **Tracking Systems Initialized**
   - `research_tracker.md` - Overall progress tracking
   - `search_log_template.md` - Template for search sessions
   - `notes_template.md` - Template for source documentation
   - `README.md` - Project documentation

### Research Conducted (0%)
- No searches executed yet

## Time Allocation

| Activity | Duration | % of Day |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Research Planning | 1.5 hrs | 30% |
| Folder Setup | 0.5 hrs | 10% |
| Documentation | 1.0 hrs | 20% |
| **Total** | **3.0 hrs** | **60%** |

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Folder Organization**: Organized by research phase rather than by jurisdiction to align with research plan workflow
2. **Naming Convention**: Standardized format `YYYY-MM-DD_[topic]_[source-type]_notes.md` for easy sorting and filtering
3. **Source Types**: Defined 8 source type categories for consistent classification
4. **Quality Standards**: Minimum 2-source verification for all findings

---

## Challenges Encountered

None yet - setup phase completed without issues.

---

## Insights and Observations

1. **Scope**: The research scope is comprehensive, covering both established frameworks (PDPO, GDPR) and emerging issues (AI liability, deepfakes)
2. **Timeliness**: AI regulation is evolving rapidly; will need to prioritize 2024-2025 sources
3. **Jurisdictional Focus**: While Hong Kong is primary, comparative analysis with EU/US/China will provide valuable context

## Tomorrow's Plan

### Priority Tasks
1. **Phase 1.1 - Hong Kong PDPO Research**
   - Execute all 5 search queries

   - Create detailed notes for official PDPO sources

2. **Begin Phase 1.2 - International Frameworks**
   - Start with GDPR research (2 searches)
   - Compare GDPR data collection principles with PDPO

### Target Metrics
- Searches completed: 7
- Sources documented: 15-20
- Notes files created: 10-15
- Screenshots: 15-20
