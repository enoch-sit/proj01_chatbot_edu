## When in Doubt

**If unsure about source credibility**:

2. Search for organization on Wikipedia (for overview)
3. Cross-check domain on official government lists
4. Look for verification badges/seals
5. Search "[organization name] official website" to find real site
6. **When still uncertain → Downgrade tier and flag for review**

**Better to be conservative**: 
- **Tier 3 is better than wrong Tier 1**
- **Documented uncertainty is better than false certainty**

---

## Final Credibility Check

Before assigning final tier, ask:

- [ ] Would a court accept this as evidence?
- [ ] Would a regulator cite this source?
- [ ] Can I verify the organization exists and is legitimate?
- [ ] Is the information current and relevant?
- [ ] Does it align with or reasonably explain differences from official sources?

**If answering "no" to most questions**: Lower the tier or reject the source.
