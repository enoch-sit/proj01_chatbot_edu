### Key Flowise Documentation Resources Relevant to Your Query
Based on the script you provided (which interacts with a Flowise prediction API endpoint), here are targeted sections from the official Flowise docs (fetched and summarized from their site). These focus on API usage, prediction endpoints, overriding configurations, handling sessions, and file uploads—elements central to the automation script.

1. **Prediction API Reference** (https://docs.flowiseai.com/api-reference/prediction):
   - This is the core endpoint for interacting with a deployed chatflow. You send a POST request to `/api/v1/prediction/{chatflowId}` with a JSON body containing the user's "question" (input message).
   - Example payload: `{"question": "Hey, how are you?"}`.
   - The API returns a JSON response with the AI's output (e.g., {"text": "Response here"}).
   - Supports streaming responses if enabled in the chatflow config.
   - Why relevant: Your script uses this exact endpoint (`API_URL = "https://aiagent.qefmoodle.com/api/v1/prediction/16fee693-5871-4362-918b-6109fe48d939"`) to simulate user messages and get AI replies.

2. **Using Prediction API** (https://docs.flowiseai.com/using-flowise/prediction):
   - Explains how to send messages to flows and receive AI responses. It's the main way to "chat" with your deployed flow programmatically.
   - Includes details on handling responses, error codes (e.g., 401 for invalid auth, 404 for no path/flow issues).
   - Tips: Use tools like Postman or cURL for testing; integrate into apps via libraries like requests in Python.
   - Why relevant: The script's `query` function wraps a POST request to this API, simulating a conversation flow.

3. **Override Config** (Mentioned across docs, e.g., https://docs.flowiseai.com/api-reference/prediction and https://docs.flowiseai.com/integrations/langchain/memory):
   - You can override chatflow inputs/configs at runtime by adding an "overrideConfig" object in the payload.
   - Example: `{"question": "Hey", "overrideConfig": {"sessionId": "mysession123", "otherParam": "value"}}`.
   - For security, overrides are disabled by default—enable them in the chatflow's Security tab (e.g., allow overriding sessionId, API keys, or custom variables).
   - Supports node-specific overrides by including node IDs (e.g., for multiple agents with different API keys).
   - Why relevant: Your script uses `"overrideConfig": {"sessionId": SESSION_ID}` to maintain a stateful conversation across turns. Without this, each API call would be stateless.

4. **Memory and Session Management** (https://docs.flowiseai.com/integrations/langchain/memory):
   - Flowise uses LangChain's memory modules to persist conversation history.
   - Specify a "sessionId" in overrideConfig to link messages to the same session (e.g., for multi-turn chats).
   - If omitted, a new session starts each time.
   - Example: In prediction API, add `"overrideConfig": {"sessionId": "session123"}`.
   - Why relevant: The script generates a unique `SESSION_ID` (e.g., based on timestamp) to keep the simulated conversation coherent, mimicking a real user session.

5. **File Uploads via API** (Not explicitly in main docs but referenced in GitHub issues and community resources, e.g., https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/issues/3299):
   - Flowise supports file uploads in chatflows (e.g., for document agents or image processing).
   - In the prediction API, include an "uploads" array in the payload: e.g., `{"uploads": [{"data": "data:image/png;base64,...", "type": "file", "name": "file.png", "mime": "image/png"}]}`.
   - This triggers backend processing (e.g., upserting to vector stores or analyzing images).
   - Note: Some users report bugs with API uploads (e.g., needing separate upsert calls), but it's functional when configured correctly.
   - Why relevant: Your script simulates a Task 5 map upload using base64-encoded image data in `uploads`, which routes the flow to handle image-based tasks.

6. **Additional Resources**:
   - **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise – For issues like API variables (e.g., #3551) and file uploads (#3299), which discuss passing custom data and troubleshooting.
   - **YouTube Tutorial on API**: "Add Flowise to ANYTHING! Flowise API Crash Course" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R5zo3IVkqU) – Covers prediction API, overrideConfig, session IDs, and integrations like LangSmith for tracing.
   - **Streamlit Integration Example**: https://docs.flowiseai.com/integrations/3rd-party-platform-integration/streamlit – Shows using prediction API with overrides in a web app.
   - **Custom Tools**: https://docs.flowiseai.com/integrations/langchain/tools/custom-tool – Relevant if your flow uses custom APIs (like the path tool in the script).

### Explanation of What Is Being Evaluated, How, and Why
The Python script you provided is an automated evaluation harness for testing a Flowise chatflow (specifically, one implementing a multi-task AI agent for teaching English directions using maps, as per the conversation history). It simulates a full user-AI conversation based on your provided flow example, sends messages via the Flowise prediction API, analyzes responses, and validates them against expected behaviors. This is essentially an end-to-end test suite to ensure the chatflow works as designed.

#### What Is Being Evaluated
- **Response Structure and Content**: Checks for mandatory elements like the initial map iframe (HTML embed), correction tables (with "Original" and "Revised" columns), guiding questions (e.g., "What is your next step?"), and task openings (e.g., "Great! Let us start Task X").
- **Directional Accuracy**: Verifies if the AI's revised directions (in tables) match the "ground truth" paths from the custom path tool API (e.g., correct turns like "turn left" vs. user's "turn right").
- **Routing and State Management**: Ensures proper task progression (e.g., jumping to Task 5 on image upload) and handles multi-turn logic without breaking session continuity.
- **Compliance with System Prompt Rules**: Implicitly tests rules like not using tools in Task 5, correcting grammar/capitalization/punctuation in tables, avoiding cardinal directions, and providing cheerful guidance.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles incomplete user inputs, task switches (e.g., "Task 2"), and uploads without crashing.
- **Overall Flow Completeness**: Confirms the AI celebrates completions and doesn't stray off-topic.

In short, it's evaluating if the chatflow adheres to the detailed system prompt (e.g., scaffolding guidance, no prepositions in questions, bolding changes in tables).

#### How It Is Being Evaluated
The script runs a simulated conversation using your provided flow (CONVERSATION_FLOW list), interacting with the Flowise API step-by-step:
1. **Setup and Simulation**:
   - Generates a unique session ID for stateful chats.
   - For each turn, sends a POST request to the prediction API with the user's message, optional overrides (e.g., sessionId), and uploads (e.g., base64 image for Task 5 simulation).
   - Uses `requests` library to handle API calls.

2. **Response Parsing and Checks**:
   - Extracts elements like locations (e.g., regex for "from X to Y") and revised directions (splits table lines).
   - Calls the path tool API independently to get "correct" directions (e.g., turn-by-turn steps).
   - Compares AI's revised directions to the path tool's output (simple string matching; could be fuzzy for better accuracy).
   - Flags failures like missing tables, forbidden tool usage in Task 5 (searches for "reading_the_map_adv_3"), or absent map iframe.

3. **Evaluation Logic** (in `evaluate_response` function):
   - Per step, checks conditions (e.g., if "expect_map" in context, verify iframe presence).
   - For tasks 1-4, validates directions match ground truth.
   - Outputs pass/fail with notes (e.g., "Missing correction table" or "Directions do not match correct path").
   - Summarizes at the end (e.g., "X/Y steps passed").

4. **Handling Uploads and Tools**:
   - Simulates map upload with a placeholder base64 PNG.
   - Integrates the path tool code directly (fetched from your message) to generate correct paths.

This is a black-box test: It treats the Flowise flow as a remote service and probes it via API, without internal access.

#### Why It Is Being Evaluated This Way
- **Automation for Efficiency**: Manual testing conversations is time-consuming and error-prone. This script runs repeatable tests quickly, ideal for CI/CD pipelines or debugging during development.
- **Validation of Complex Logic**: The chatflow has intricate rules (e.g., task routing on uploads, step-by-step guidance without spoiling answers, precise corrections). Automated checks ensure consistency across turns and catch regressions (e.g., if a prompt change breaks table generation).
- **Quality Assurance**: By comparing to ground truth (path tool), it verifies factual accuracy (directions) and prompt adherence (e.g., no cardinal directions, bolding only changes). This prevents issues like incorrect teaching or poor user experience.
- **Scalability and Debugging**: Supports adding more flows/tests; highlights failures with notes for quick fixes. Why API-based? Flowise is designed for API integration, so this mirrors real-world usage (e.g., in apps or bots).
- **Security/Edge Testing**: Includes overrides and uploads to test state management and routing, ensuring the flow handles real inputs securely (e.g., no tool misuse in Task 5).

If the evaluation fails (e.g., due to mismatches), it could indicate bugs in the chatflow nodes, prompt misconfigurations, or API changes in Flowise. You can extend the script with more assertions or fuzzy matching for robustness. Let me know if you want help modifying it!
