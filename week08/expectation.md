# Chatbot Evaluation Expectations

**Important**: All assistant responses contain markdown formatting (HTML code blocks, markdown tables, bold text, etc.). Judge the content as rendered markdown, not raw text.

Describe general expectations here. Use `## Step N` headings for step-specific requirements. For example:

## Step 1

- The assistant must display the map iframe (embedded as HTML code block with `<iframe>` tag).
- The response should invite the learner to start Task 1.

## Step 2

- Provide a correction table (markdown table format with `|` separators) covering grammar and capitalization.
- The table should show Original vs Revised columns.
- Ask the learner for the next action.

## Default

**Markdown Format Requirements:**
- Assistant responses may contain HTML code blocks (wrapped in ```html ... ```).
- Correction tables should use markdown table syntax with proper headers and alignment.
- Look for content within the markdown structure, not just raw text.

**General Expectations:**
- When tasks are introduced (Task 2, Task 3, Task 4), outline the requirements clearly before asking for the response.
- Provide specific feedback using markdown tables when correcting user input.
- Guide the learner with clear instructions and appropriate scaffolding.
