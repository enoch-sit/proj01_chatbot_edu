✅ 1. DATASETS
   - Created 'Math Calculator QA' with 4 examples
   - Includes inputs, expected outputs, and metadata

✅ 2. TOOL USAGE & TRAJECTORY
   - Defined 3 calculator tools (add, multiply, divide)
   - Tracked tool calls in agent trajectory
   - Evaluated correct tool usage

✅ 3. A/B TESTING
   - Variant A: Formal system prompt
   - Variant B: Friendly system prompt
   - Ran separate experiments for each variant

✅ 4. MULTIPLE EVALUATORS
   - Correctness: String match for numerical answers
   - Tool Usage: Trajectory evaluation
   - LLM-as-Judge: Helpfulness assessment
   - Response Length: Conciseness check

✅ 5. EXPERIMENTS
   - Two independent experiments (A and B)
   - Metadata tracking for comparison
   - Full traces and metrics in LangSmith UI

✅ 6. RESULTS
   - Formal: More concise, faster
   - Friendly: More helpful, engaging
   - Both: Equally correct, perfect tool usage`,
